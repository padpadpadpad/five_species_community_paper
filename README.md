# Repository for the analyses characterising the 5 species community

## Outline

## Using this repository

The GitHub repo should be easy to use on everyoneâ€™s machine using RStudio projects. RStudio projects automatically assigns the root directory to the directory in which the project resides. Consequently all of the analyses should be runnable without altering paths. Simply double-click on the .Rproj folder that is in the base folder of this repository and it should open the project in RStudio. All the packages used in the script should be at the top of each script, and RStudio usually requests you install them if they are not installed already.
